Forming of the EU
================

Forming of the EU
----------

- 1950: European Coal and Steel Community
- 1992: Signing of the Maastricht Treaty
- EU and Economic and Monetary Union were formed
- 1997: SGP entered into force
- SGP matters because it ensures fiscal prudence and commitment to the EMU


Critiques and reforms
=================

Critiques and reforms
-----------


- France and Germany both violated the rules but weren't punished
- Fiscal monitoring rules too stricht and inflexible
- 2005: Reform: MTO's country specific, deadline of 'excessive deficits' prolonged by a year
- 2011: Reform: automatic procedure for imposing penalty



Methodology
=================

Methodology
-----------

- Measure effect of SGP on debt-to-GDP ratio and yearly budget balance for early-joining countries and late-joining countries

- Data from IMF, Eurostat, OECD Databases
- Missing data
- Control countries
   - Denmark, Sweden, UK, US, Canada, Japan, Korea, Norway, Switzerland
- Sensitivity analysis
   - Belgium, Greece, Japan, Italy

-----------

Regressions:

$Debt_{i,t}=\alpha + \beta_1Early_i + \beta_2Late_i + \beta_3Afterearly_{i,t} + \beta_4Afterlate_{i,t} + \beta_5X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$

$BudgetBalance_{i,t}=\alpha + \beta_1Early_i + \beta_2Late_i + \beta_3Afterearly_{i,t} + \beta_4Afterlate_{i,t} + \beta_5X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$

$X_{i,t}$ set of control variables:
- output gap as proxy for business cycle
- real interest rate as proxy for monetary policy
- dummy for Great Recession period

Results
=================

Regression results
----------

- Debt after SGP increases compared to control countries for both early and late joining countries
- BB before SGP worse than control countries, but becomes less negative after SGP for late-joining countries
- Control variables all significant at 1% level

----------

Equality test
----------

Only reject null-hypothesis in two cases:
- Debt: in Table 1 both coefficients not statistically significant
- BB: Late joining countries improve BB, but remain worse than control countries while late-joining countries worsen their BB compares to control countries


Conclusion
----------

- Little to no differences between the early- and late joining countries regarding the impact of the SGP on the debt-to-GDP ratio and the budget balance
   - Late joining countries improve BB, but remains worse than control countries while late-joining countries worsen their BB compared to control countries
   - Debt of both the early- and late joining countries increases after the rules of the SGP are put into place

Further research
- Less missing data
- Later than 2004 joining countries
