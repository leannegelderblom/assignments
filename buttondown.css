<p>% Buttondown Stylesheet Example % Pandoc Markdown Version % February 2012 Headers ======= Above this, we have the title, author (or subtitle) and date Pandoc metadata. These are specially classed H1, H2 and H3 elements that we just add centering to. ## Level 2 With Pandoc's `--section-divs` option, nested header levels create nested DIVs. This stylesheet creates nested indentation for them to nest visually. ### Level 3 I should create some auxiliary CSS files that you could include after `buttondown.css` to change some things like turning off nested indenting. #### Level 4 Buttondown doesn't re-define the font size or weight of the headers, but it does define the font families for them as sans- serf. ##### Level 5 It doesn't re-define the body text font, and it doesn't make the text body narrow --- it leaves it full width. I will probably add a style option file for that. ###### Level 6 Level 6 can be quite small. Lists ===== Unordered lists --------------- ### A simple list: Text before * Alpha * Beta * Gamma Text after ### A nested list: * Alpha * Apple * Orange * Beta - A multi-line item to show where the wrapping and sublist line up. - Earth - Moon - Pineapple * Gamma (with numbered sublist) 1. One 2. Two ### A paragraph spaced one: Not all stylesheets make these have more spacing. * Alpha * Beta * Gamma And the spacing after might be too tight. Ordered lists ------------- ### A simple one: 1. One 2. Two 3. Three ### A nested one: 1. One 1. Alpha 2. Beta 2. Two (with unordered sublist) * Gamma * Delta 3. Three 1. Apple 1. Circle 2. Triangle 1. North 1. East 2. West 2. South * Up * Down 3. Square 1. Orange Block Quotes ============ We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration since they are already indented on the left and right. &gt; We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration since they are already indented on the left and right. Code ==== Code blocks are styled more to be set apart a bit more than just the monospaced font. A light background color and border (in case the background doesn't print, but it looks nice too). x = e * 10 / 2; y = p - 7; On screen, the blocks provide scroll boxes and the `inline code spans` word wrap. For print, the code blocks also change to word wrap. On screen, the `code spans` also get a little border, but lose it in print. Links ===== Remove the underline except on hover. When printing, remove all styling and print external URLs after the link text to be useful in a printout. There is no filter to not print very long URLs though. A link to [Google][]. A simple link to . I haven't figured out how to not redundantly print the URL after a simple link whose link text is the URL. [Google]: http://www.google.com Horizontal rule =============== A thin line that doesn't have that shadow thing that looks terrible, especially in print. - - - See the end for what footnotes looks like[^1]. [^1]: A double-line rule with the word &quot;NOTES&quot; in the center. Images ====== An inline image ![](http://www.jodypaul.com/gr/altair8800Thumb.gif &quot;www.jodypaul.com&quot;). A Pandoc figure style image with caption: ![Daring Fireball][DFlogo] [DFlogo]: http://daringfireball.net/graphics/logos/ &quot;Daring Fireball!&quot; Definition Lists ================ Still may tweak this. Trying to use subtle lines to help group it, but it feels a bit too table-like. However, without them, it doesn't seem to stand out much. Term : Definition of the term Term2 : First definition of Term2 It can be a long, wrapped paragraph like this. A definition can include multiple paragraphs if they are indented the same in Pandoc and MultiMarkdown 3. MultiMarkdown 2 doesn't support this, so it will be interpreted there as a code block following the Term2 definition. - They can also include Markdown - If it supports multiple paragraphs, a definition can contain lists and things - But the first has to start as a regular paragraph Term3 : A term can have multiple definitions. : The second definition of Term3. Depending on the stylesheet for HTML you are using or the output format (LaTeX, etc.), this second definition may appear styled as a separate term but without the term itself. Tables ====== These get more styling than most things, yet it's still very little compared to most table stylings, but way better than an un-styled HTML table. It's to emulate a simple textbook style, but we throw in a hover row highlight to be a little useful on-screen when scrubbing around the table.
